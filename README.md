# DriverPass

- - DriverPass Project Summary - -

    
The DriverPass project involved designing a user-friendly online system for DriverPass, a company that helps students pass their driving tests. The client noticed that many students failed their DMV tests because they lacked proper preparation tools. To solve this problem, they wanted a unified system that allowed students to register, select training packages, schedule driving lessons, practice online tests, and track their progress. They also required administrative features like user management, scheduling oversight, and integration with DMV updates.

I feel that my biggest strength in this project was accurately capturing the client's requirements. I was particularly effective at identifying specific use cases and turning those into well-defined system features.

If I were to revise one area, I would improve my UML diagrams—specifically their layout and readability. Initially, my diagrams were somewhat cluttered, which made them hard to quickly understand. Next time, I'd take more time to ensure my diagrams were cleanly organized, easy to follow, and clearly labeled so developers could quickly reference them.

Interpreting the user's needs was central to my design approach. I reviewed the client's interview carefully, focusing on real-world tasks students and staff would perform, such as booking lessons or resetting passwords. Ensuring my design directly addressed these tasks was crucial, as a good system needs to be intuitive and reflect how real users actually behave.

When designing software, I typically start by mapping out user interactions, focusing on clear workflows and realistic scenarios. From there, I move into creating UML diagrams, starting with high-level views (like use cases) and working down into detailed class and sequence diagrams. Moving forward, I'll continue using this approach, but I plan to add earlier feedback loops—getting frequent input from stakeholders—to help catch potential issues early on. This will ensure the final design remains aligned with client expectations and user needs throughout the entire development process.
